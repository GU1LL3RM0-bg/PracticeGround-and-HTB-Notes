Can connect using anonymous but none of the files is accessible to me.

Checking the folder "Accounts" we can see 3 potential user acccounts:

```
Offsec
anonymous
admin
```

Using hydra against these users, we found that `admin:admin` is valid. Which allows us to download the `.htpasswd` password from the ftp server.

This file contains a password that we can crack.

### Initial Access

I logged into the web server 242 using `offsec:elite`

I was able to upload a php reverse shell from ivan (which works on windows too) and got initial access that way.

Note: I tried several msfvenom, powershell and nc.exe rev shell but none of them worked, simply because I DIDN'T check the OS version and I was trying to run x64 payloads on a 32 bit system :'D `Ã±ame`

### Priv Esc

For privilege escalation, I grabbed the info from `systeminfo` and ran it through the windows exploit suggester. I filter only for privilege escalation exploit with known available exploit. I ended using https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40564 (MS11-046) which had a compiled exploit binary already compiled in secWiki/windows-kernel-exploit github repo :D
