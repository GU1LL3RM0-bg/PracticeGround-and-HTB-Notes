This host has ssh open on port 2222 and we are allowed to connect to it using anitas ssh private key.

Once connected, we were able to find that there's a internal web server only available via port 8000 to the localhost ***127.0.0.1:8000***

I created a remote port forwarding using ssh to reach the internal webs ever on 8000 from kali's 8888

After further analysis, I found that this webpage had a LFI vulnerability, allowing me to execute file located inside the server, as well as listing the content of existing files.
Note, we are only able to see and execute what's available for **www-data**.
#### Directory traversal / LFI

#### Foothold:

We can leverage the fact that we got access to the internal server via anita as ssh user. Knowing this, we can find a path that's both writable for www-data and anita and we can create a simple php shell, in order to achieve RCE via LFI and execute code from the internal server as www-data.

Using the following command I found that anita has write perms on /dev/shm.

Next, I create a simple php backdoor with 777 perms on /dev/sh,:

Next, I started a listener on ligolo to forward traffic from the server 192.168.205.246:4444 to our proxy server in kali over port 4444 and started a nc listener on 4444 in kali.

Using curl on 127.0.0.1:8000, I triggered RCE via LFI and executed an encoded one liner reverse shell in bash:

Then, I received a rev shell back:

#### From www-data to Root

> Running "sudo -l" I was able to see that www-data can run ANY command as root. We can easily escalate to root by running "sudo su".
