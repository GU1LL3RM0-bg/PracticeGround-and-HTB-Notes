We are tasked with a penetration test of _Relia_, an industrial company building driving systems for the timber industry. The target got attacked a few weeks ago and wants now to get an assessment of their IT security. Their goal is to determine if an attacker can breach the perimeter and get access to the domain controller in the internal network.

The organization topology diagram is shown below and the public subnet network resides in the `192.168.xx.0/24` range, where the `xx` of the third octet can be found under the _IP ADDRESS_ field in the control panel.
